Using various statistical methods, we created a recommendation for the most important features to focus on to be successful in the Austin Airbnb Market.

Given a data set with 53 columns and around 6000 rows, we were required to use exploratory analysis, linear regression, classification, and clustering to discover insights such as "What factors play an important role in nightly rental price?" and "What are key attributes of units that are booked more often than others?".

Finally, our insights were compiled into a report explaining our findings and recommendations to a business audience.
